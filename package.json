  "description": "Igloo is a minimal, fluent, object-oriented wrapper API for WebGL. The\r idea is to maintain WebGL's low-level graphics access but fit it to\r JavaScript idioms and simplify the API. It's designed to play *very*\r well with [glMatrix](http://glmatrix.net/), though its use is not\r strictly required.",
